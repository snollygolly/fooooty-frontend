                            <ol type="a">
                            <li>Fooooty is football/soccer simulation game, based on the 1980's PBM game 'UNITED' by Alan Parr. The sections of the rules taken from Alan Parr's 'UNITED' are marked (*) and are freely copyable, distributable, changeable, as long as no profit is made from the copy, and the orginal copyright is acknowledged to Alan Parr. Therefore those sections of the rules are copyright Alan Parr, but the code to implement the game, the look and feel of this web version, the artwork and all text not in those sections (such as the additional rules created by Fooooty Productions in order to implement this web version of the game), are copyright Fooooty Productions and may not be reproduced without written consent from Fooooty Productions.
                            </li><li>In Fooooty, we refer to the game as 'football', but our North American cousins will know the game as 'soccer'. When we say 'football' in Fooooty, we do not mean the game in which the oddly shaped, not-quite-a-ball is carried around in your hands rather than kicked with the foot. Fooooty is all about the game with the spherical ball kicked with the foot, in which David Beckham excels. No more will be said on the subject.
                            </li><li>In Fooooty, you take on the role of a football club manager, and have total control over coaching, team selection, tactics, buying and selling of players, and finances. Most divisions have 10 clubs, so you'll play 9 home and 9 away matches per season for a total of 18, plus some cup matches and maybe some friendlies too if you are so inclined. The season is created so that you play 2 league games per week, plus a week at the end for cup finals and tying up loose ends - this means a complete season lasts 10 weeks. There are places in the game where you can chat publicly to other managers, and generally have a good time outside of managing your club.

                            <li>You are only allowed one account in Fooooty. We compare IP addresses to make sure that you are only managing one club, and we check email addresses so that no email address has more than one club associated with it. We also keep an eye on transfers and 'throwing matches', but please remember it ruins the game for other players if you break this rule.
                            </li><li>Offensive language and questionable conduct can also ruin the game for others, so please keep the swearing to a minimum, though some discretion is given (which is why there's a minimum age of 18 for playing Fooooty!). Bad language may be edited or removed by the admins, but only in extreme cases. Warnings will be given for continued bad behaviour, and as a last resort we will ban you from the game. The admins decision will be final in all matters, and no refunds will be given for any reason.
                            </li><li>Manually browsing to a specific Fooooty web page is not allowed. Editing the address bar while playing Fooooty is not allowed. Attempting to hack the game in any way is not allowed. Logging in as another user is not allowed. Disclosing your password to anyone (even admins) is not allowed. Posing as admins or moderators is not allowed. If you find a bug that affects gameplay, you must report it immediately. Breaking any of these rules is grounds for instant banning at the discretion of the admins.

                            <li>Your club will have a name that you cannot change except at the start of a new season. (Chairmen can rename their club at any time - see below)
                            </li><li>A club name will initially have a suffix of 'United', e.g. if you name your club 'Westcliff' its full name by default will be 'Westcliff United'. (This is an homage to the original game United, on which Fooooty is based).
                            </li><li>You may change the suffix by spending Victory Points (VPs - see below).
                            </li><li>Your club will be located in a certain part of your home nation. Each nation is split into various halves:<br>
                            <i>North/South, West/East, Inner/Outer, Urban/Rural, Town/Village.</i><br>
                            So a club could be, for example, located in North-East-Inner-Rural-Village. The location of a club determines which Regional Cups it can join (see below), and the cost of travel to away matches.

                            <li>You are a manger in the game, so when we refer to 'players' we do not mean real human beings - we mean the fictional group of misfits that make up your club.
                            </li><li>Players in the game cannot be renamed. If you hold the rank of Chairman rather than Manager (see below), you are allowed to name new players as you discover them from your Youth Program.
                            </li><li>(*) All players have a native position on the field in which they play. There are six possible positions:
                                <ol type="1">
                                <li>Goalkeeper, abbreviated to GK
                                </li><li>Sweeper, abbreviated to SW
                                </li><li>Defender, abbreviated to DF
                                </li><li>Midfield, abbreviated to MF
                                </li><li>Forward, abbreviated to FW
                                </li><li>Utility, abbreviated to UT
                                </li></ol>
                                The DF + MF + FW areas are collectively known as the 'outfield'. Only UT players can play in any outfield area without disadvantage.
                            </li><li>(*) At the end of every season, each player ages by one and loses skill levels (see below) equal to his new age. A player begins his life as a schoolboy (SBY), and at the end of his first season becomes an apprentice (APP). At the end of the next season he becomes age I, then age II, then age III and so on until they retire. (Ages beyond APP are denoted in roman numerals). For example a player age II will become age III at the end of the season, and lose 3 skill levels. Youth players (SBY and APP) do not lose skills upon aging.
                            </li><li>(*) Players with a negative skill level will immediately retire, and cannot be brought back into the game. There is no upper limit to a players skill level. Skill levels are increased through coaching (see below).
                            </li></ol>

                            <li>From your list of available players, (your 'roster'), you must pick exactly 11 players to play your next match. These 11 players are known as your 'squad'. If you do not pick a squad before the match is played, the computer will randomly pick 11 players from your roster to become your squad for that one match.
                            </li><li>(*) There must be exactly one GK in your squad.
                            </li><li>(*) You have the option of playing one SW in your squad if you wish.
                            </li><li>(*) There must be at least 2 players in each of the outfield areas.
                            </li><li>(*) The area total (see below) of any outfield area cannot be more than 3 times that of any other outfield area. e.g. if the FW area total is 20, then neither DF nor MF could be more than 60 or less than 7. This restriction applies after all additions (see below) but before injuries and sendings off (see below) and has no effect on GK or SW. If your club somehow manages to break this rule, the extra levels will be ignored.
                            </li><li>After each match is played, your squad is cleared and must be re-selected before the next match. It is strongly advised therefore to log back in after each match and select the squad before your next match. If you are a Chairman, you have the option of retaining your squad after each game, making things a little easier for you.

                            </li><li>(*) All shots have to beat the opponents SW (if they are playing one), and then have to beat their GK.
                            </li><li>(*) If you have no shots from any area, 1 free shot will be awarded to your FW.
                            </li><li>(*) SW chance of stopping a shot is [30+(level x 2)]%
                            </li><li>(*) GK chance of stopping a shot is [40+(level x 2.25)]%
                            </li><li>(*) Any shot that beats the GK is a goal.
                            </li><li>(*) The club with the most goals wins. If the goals scored are equal, the match is a Draw unless it is a cup match in which case a penalty shootout will decide the winner.
                            </li><li>For league matches you are awarded 3 points for a Win, 1 point for a Draw, and no points for a loss. (Some leagues may change this point allocation in the future).
                            </li><li>For winning a cup match you are awarded 3 VPs, for a league win you get 2 VPs, for a league draw or a friendly win, you get 1 VP. You can exchange VPs for CPs or other in-game goodies.

                            <li>(*) Home Advantage: The first named club in a match is designated to be playing at home (Home v Away). Assuming the home club is playing in their own stadium, they get an extra 7 levels to be split between the three outfield areas.
                            </li><li>If you employ a Groundsman (see below) you can increase your Home Advantage.
                            </li><li>(*) Great Performance Points (GPP). Each club has 30 GPPs to begin the season with. These can be assigned in any match, but cannot be carried over from one season to the next. They can be assigned to any outfield area with a maximum of 9 per match.
                            </li><li>(*) A club choosing to Play For a Draw (PFD) has 7 extra levels to split between SW, DF and MF, but its total shots will be halved (rounded down).
                            </li><li>(*) Provided a club does not field a SW, they can play the Off-Side Trap (OST). This halves the number of shots the opposing FW gets, but doubles the number of shots the opposing MF gets.
                            </li><li>(*) In each game, a manager can choose to add extra levels by playing hard. The number of extra points can be from 0 (weeds) to 9 (assassins), spread over the various areas as the manager decides. If a manager wished, he could play 9 hardness in every match.

                            </li><li>(*) Red/Yellow cards: For each player in a match there is a chance that he will be given a Yellow Card and booked (incurring 4 DPs) or given a Red Card and sent off (incurring 10 DPs).

Only league and cup matches count - friendlies not played do not count as matches having been 'sat-out', nor can a player be selected to play in a friendly if they are banned.
                            </li><li>The number of matches to be sat out are as follows:

                            Note that it's possible for a player to have 18 DPs before a match, get booked and sent off during the match and therefore accrue 14 DPs thus putting him on 32 DPs. He would then have to sit out 8 matches; 3 for passing 20 DPs and 5 for passing 30 DPs. Playing hard is a short term fix for a long term problem!
                            </li><li>(*) There is a 10% chance of conceding a penalty for every level of hardness used. If no hardness is used there is still a 5% chance of conceding a penalty.
                            </li><li>(*) The chance of a penalty being scored is [50 + (4 x penalty takers skill) - (2 x GK skill)]% to a maximum of 95%
                            </li><li>(*) A player who is sent off will be deemed to operate at half their skill level for the entire match.
                            </li><li>(*) DPs are cumulative throughout the season.
                            </li><li>(*) At the end of the season, DPs are rounded down to the nearest 10, and then 20 DPs are subtracted (down to a minimum of 0, no negative DPs!).

                            <li>Newbie account: All newcomers start off in Fooooty with a restricted set of menu items available to them. Once a series of actions are performed, which are designed to introduce new users to the interface and mechanics of the game, a Newbie will be awarded a Managerial account. It's possible to progress to a full-blown Managerial account within minutes, but it is suggested that you take time to get to know the game before you move on to the fully-fledged Managerial account.
                            </li><li>Managerial account: This is the basic account type for all users of Fooooty, and it shows that you've gone through the basics of most parts of the game, and understood how things work.
                            </li><li>Chairman account: This account type is available to all non-Newbie Managers. It costs 8 Credits per calendar month. Credits can be bought through Paypal, priced 100 credits for USD20.00/CAD20.00/GBP10.00/EUR15.00
